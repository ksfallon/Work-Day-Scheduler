Our task for this Homework assignment is to create a calendar and each hour can be adjusted to add events for your day. It requires the use of jQuery and Moment.js.
When the planner is opened it should open to the current day, and the schedule is coded by color to display past, present and future events. In each time block the user can save information about a specific event and that will be held in local storage. That way the events are not removed from the schedule when the page is refreshed but only removed when local storage is cleared.
